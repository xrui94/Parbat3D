# Parbat3D

Parbat3D is a tool for visualising these satellite images. It allows very large images that may have multiple bands to be viewed quickly and easily. The images can be viewed as the standard 2D image or plotted to a 3D feature space, which is a scatterplot of all the pixels in the image. Parbat3D also allows the Regions of Interest to be selected in the 2D image and these will show up in the feature space.

**Note:** This project is a fork of Project [Parbat3D](https://github.com/rowanj/Parbat3D), with various modifications and upgrades. As of November 1, 2025, the original project has not been updated for approximately 16 years.
